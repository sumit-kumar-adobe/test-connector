<taskbody><context><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the primary
Internet routing protocol. BGP determines network reachability based
on IP prefixes that are available within autonomous systems (AS),
where an AS is a set of IP prefixes that a network provider has
designated to be part of a single routing policy. </p><p>In the
routing process, connections are established between BGP peers (or neighbors).
If a route is permitted by the policy, it is stored in the routing
information base (RIB). Each time the local firewall RIB is updated,
the firewall determines the optimal routes and sends an update to
the external RIB, if export is enabled.</p><p>Conditional advertisement
is used to control how BGP routes are advertised. The BGP routes
must satisfy conditional advertisement rules before being advertised to
peers.</p><p>BGP supports the specification of aggregates, which
combine multiple routes into a single route. During the aggregation
process, the first step is to find the corresponding aggregation
rule by performing a longest match that compares the incoming route
with the prefix values for other aggregation rules.</p><p>For more
information on BGP, refer to <xref
href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Articles/Tech-Note-How-to-Configure-BGP/ta-p/62581"
format="html" scope="external">How to Configure BGP Tech Note</xref>.</p><p>The
firewall provides a complete BGP implementation, which includes
the following features:</p><ul><li><p>Specification of one BGP routing
instance per virtual router.</p></li>
<li><p>Routing policies based on route-map to control import, export
and advertisement, prefix-based filtering, and address aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced BGP features that include route reflector, AS confederation, route
flap dampening, and graceful restart.</p></li>
<li><p>IGP-BGP interaction to inject routes to BGP using redistribution profiles.</p></li></ul><p>BGP
configuration consists of the following elements:</p><ul><li><p>Per-routing-instance
settings, which include basic parameters such as local route ID
and local AS and advanced options such as path selection, route
reflector, AS confederation, route flap, and dampening profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication profiles, which specify the MD5 authentication
key for BGP connections. Authentication helps prevent route leaking
and successful DoS attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer group and neighbor settings, which include neighbor
address and remote AS and advanced options such as neighbor attributes
and connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Routing policy, which specifies rule sets that peer groups
and peers use to implement imports, exports, conditional advertisements,
and address aggregation controls. </p></li></ul><p>Perform the following
procedure to configure BGP.</p></context>

<info><p>The import/export rules are used to import/export routes
from/to other routers. For example, importing the default route from
your Internet Service Provider.</p></info>
<substeps><substep><cmd>Select the <uicontrol>Import</uicontrol> tab
and then click <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> and enter a name in the <uicontrol>Rules</uicontrol> field

Group</uicontrol> to which the routes will be imported from.</cmd></substep>
<substep><cmd>Click the <uicontrol>Match</uicontrol> tab and define
the options used to filter routing information. You can also define the
Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED) value and a next hop value to routers
or subnets for route filtering. The MED option is an external metric
that lets neighbors know about the preferred path into an AS. A
lower value is preferred over a higher value.</cmd></substep>
<substep><cmd>Click the <uicontrol>Action</uicontrol> tab and define
the action that should occur (allow/deny) based on the filtering options
defined in the <uicontrol>Match</uicontrol> tab. If <uicontrol>Deny</uicontrol> is
selected, no further options need to be defined. If the <uicontrol>Allow</uicontrol> action
is selected, define the other attributes.</cmd></substep>

the route that you want to advertise, if it is available in the

when at least one or more specific route matching the address specified
is learned. </p></info>
